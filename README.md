# Dedecms-v5.7.109-RCE

Since CVE-2022-43192 is not fully fixed, Dedecms still has a file upload vulnerability, leading to RCE.
After the vendor released 8 versions of patch updates, I still discovered a vulnerability here.
And the exploitation method is different from CVE-2022-43192.

## Vulnerability Analysis

After adding comments to the code, the system will recognize the comment symbol /\*\*/ and ignore all the code within it during the checking process. This makes it easy to upload files without detection. However, please note that in some cases, such as during actual access, the /\*\*/ comment symbols may not work as expected and the code within can still be executed.
